Repository for the paper "Leveraging chaotic transients in the training of artificial neural networks" (2026), Pedro Jiménez-González, Miguel C. Soriano and Lucas Lacasa, https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08523

This repository provides a baseline implementation of the data-generation pipeline used in the paper. The included MNIST example produces divergence trajectories from neural network training.
Post-processing steps (e.g., Lyapunov exponent fitting, statistical analysis, and figure generation) are not included in this repository.
Other architectures, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations reported in the paper follow the same structure and analysis procedure, differing only in model definition and data source.
For any questions regarding the implementation or methodology, please feel free to contact me pjimenez@ifisc.uib-csic.es
