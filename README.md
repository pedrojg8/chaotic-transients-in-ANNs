Repository for the paper "Leveraging chaotic transients in the training of artificial neural networks" (2026), Pedro Jiménez-González, Miguel C. Soriano and Lucas Lacasa, https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08523

This repository provides the baseline implementation of the divergence analysis used in the paper. The included MNIST (MLP–tanh) example illustrates the complete computational pipeline.
Other architectures, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations reported in the paper follow the same structure and analysis procedure, differing only in model definition and data source.
For any questions regarding the implementation or methodology, please feel free to contact me pjimenez@ifisc.uib-csic.es
